Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you approach your first Data Science project.
Start with Your Research Goal
Before writing any code, take a moment to frame your project around a research or business question.

Step 1: Choose a dataset you're interested in.

Step 2: Define one or two open-ended questions.
•	These should be exploratory, not yes/no questions. Ask yourself:
•	What do I want to learn, prove, or explore with this data?
•	Examples of open-ended research questions
•	Use flexible templates like these:
•	What is the impact of [X] on [Y]?
           [X] will usually be a category or group
           [Y] is an outcome you want to understand or explain - it can be represented by one or more columns in your dataset, or it might involve creating a new one
•	What trends or patterns can I find in [key behavior or metric]?

•	This general question will help you decide:
•	which columns matter
•	what to clean
•	what patterns to look for
•	what types of plots or groupings to use

Your research questions should guide every step of your analysis — from cleaning to EDA to the final SQL queries. 

step 3 :Data check
Once you’ve selected your dataset, begin by exploring and cleaning the data. The goal is to prepare a clean, focused dataset that aligns with your research questions.

Start by loading your dataset using pandas. Then:
Use .head(), .shape and .info() to get a feel for the data structure.
Check for:
•	Missing values - identify where your data might be incomplete (df.isnull().sum())
•	Duplicates (full rows) - avoid repeated data entries (df.duplicated().sum())
•	Duplicates in key columns - check for duplicates in fields that should be unique (e.g., user ID, transaction ID)
•	Data types - make sure columns are correctly typed (df.dtypes)
•	Number of unique values per column (df.nunique()) - helps identify which columns are likely categorical
    If a column has only a handful of unique values compared to the number of rows, it likely represents a category, not a continuous variable.
•	Invalid or extreme values (e.g., negative ages or impossible prices) - these can often be spotted in the output of: df.describe(include="all")

step 4 :Start data cleaning
•	Drop unnecessary columns
•	Keep only the variables that help you answer your research questions.
•	If a column like an ID is unique and not used in your analysis, consider setting it as the index (e.g., df.set_index("user_id")) instead of dropping it.
•	Handle missing values
•	Decide on a strategy based on the column’s importance and the amount of missing data:
•	Drop rows or columns (df.dropna())
•	Fill in values with mean, median, mode, or a placeholder (df.fillna())
•	Or keep them (if missingness itself tells you something!)
•	Handle duplicates
•	Remove fully duplicated rows with df.drop_duplicates()
•	Convert column types where needed
•	Use pd.to_datetime() for date fields
•	Use .astype() to fix numeric or categorical types
•	Fix or remove invalid values
•	Decide whether to correct, remove, or flag them based on your analysis goals

DON'T FORGET TO:
Document your cleaning process
•	Write explanations in Markdown cells as you go
•	This makes your notebook readable and explains your decision-making clearly.

AND FINALLY:
Save your cleaned dataset as a new CSV file:
df.to_csv("cleaned_data.csv", index=False)
(You will be using this cleaned dataset in SQL later on)[EDA]
You are now done with Data Cleaning and ready to proceed to EDA!
Follow your Univariate and Bivariate lesson notebooks to guide your process.

Step 1: Identify Variable Types

Classify your columns into:
	Numerical variables (e.g., age, income)
	Categorical variables (e.g., gender, country)
This classification determines what types of plots and summary statistics you’ll use.

Step 2: Univariate EDA (One Variable at a Time)
Now, explore each variable individually - but only the ones relevant to your goal.
•	For numerical variables:
•	Use .describe() for summary stats.
•	Visualize distributions with histograms or boxplots.
•	For categorical variables:
•	Use .value_counts() to see frequency counts.
•	Visualize with bar plots (or pie charts, if you must  ).
This step helps you understand the shape, spread, and patterns in your key variables.
Step 3: Bivariate EDA (Two Variables at a Time)
After univariate EDA, analyze relationships between two or more variables using:
•	Grouped summaries (e.g., df.groupby())
•	Cross-tabs (e.g., pd.crosstab())
•	Scatter plots, bar plots, boxplots, etc.
Again, focus only on the relationships that are relevant to your research question.
•	Step 4: From EDA to Questions
•	
o	Once you understand your data:
	Develop at least 10 simple questions that your cleaned dataset could help answer.
	These questions should be:
	Relevant to your research goal
	Based on insights from your EDA
	Answerable using simple SQL queries
	Example questions:
	What is the average age of customers in each region?
	How many products were purchased by each membership type?
	What is the total revenue per product category?
