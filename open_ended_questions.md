1. Policyholder Characteristics
How does customer age influence the likelyhood of filling a claim?
Does the subscription length affect the frequency or probability of claims?
Are there regional differences in claim rates based on region_density?

2. Vehicle Characteristics
How does vehicle age impact the probability of a claim?
Do certain vehicle models have higher claim rates?
Are vehicles with more airbags or safety features (ESC, TPMS, parking sensors, parking cameras) less likely to file claims?
How do fuel types affect claim likelihood?
how does the car performance impact the claim rate

5. Multi-Factor Relationships
How does the combination of customer age and vehicle age affect claim probability? Are middle-aged customers with very old vehicles at higher risk?
How do combinations of vehicle characteristics and customer demographics impact claim risk?
How do all features related to car performance affect the claim rate?

6. Exploratory Trends
Are there any outliers or extreme cases (e.g., very old vehicles with very high claims)?
Can we identify high risk groups based on vehicle and customer attributes? (corelation heatmap)
